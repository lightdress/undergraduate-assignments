This course took place in the first semester of Grade 3.

Our captain used GitHub to manage [his codes](https://github.com/Whitesad/dentist_management.git),
but the final version, containing my codes, was not uploaded.

The project is the server of a dentist platform.
I remember that our team contains four members.
At first, our captain asked me to write codes about TLS security.
Nevertheless, we found it didn't have any workload since it is easy for Node.js programs to support HTTPS.
Then he asked me to handle how to avoid SQL injection,
and next, we recognised that the mod we introduced into our codes was safe enough to deal with that question.

Finally, I wrote instant messaging.
I remember I used [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) to achieve this function, but all codes related have been lost.
