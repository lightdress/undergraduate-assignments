This course took place in the second semester of Grade 2.
The textbook is _Digital Image Process, Third Edition_ by Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods,
and both teachers were serious about the course.

There were several assignments,
but I only reserve the final project now.

I got the example input picture from Zhihu.
It is a screenshot of [a Navel's gal game](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%88%E3%81%AB%E5%AF%84%E3%82%8A%E3%81%9D%E3%81%86%E4%B9%99%E5%A5%B3%E3%81%AE%E4%BD%9C%E6%B3%95),
so its copyright belongs to Omegavision, Inc.

The project was finished during the age of OpenCV version 2.
